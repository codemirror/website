# CodeMirror 6 website

This repository holds the sources for the work-in-progress [new website
for CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net/6/).

For now, it expects to be checked out inside a (compiled) [`codemirror.next`](https://github.com/codemirror/codemirror.next)
repository (it needs access to the sources to build the reference
docs).

```
npm i
npm run build
ls output # ‚Üê the website is in there
```
