# System Guide

This is the guide to the CodeMirror editor system. It provides a prose
description of the system's functionality. For the item-by-item
documentation of its interface, see the [reference manual](../ref/).

## Architecture Overview

Because CodeMirror is structured quite a bit differently than your
classical JavaScript library (including its own previous versions), it
is recommended to read at least this section before jumping in, so
that you don't waste your time with mismatched expectations.

### Modularity

CodeMirror is set up as a collection of separate modules that,
together, provide a full-featured text and code editor. On the bright
side, this means that you can pick and choose which features you need,
and even replace core functionality with a custom implementation if
you need to. On the less bright side, this means that setting up an
editor requires you to put together a bunch of pieces.

The putting-together part isn't hard, but you will have to install and
import the pieces you need. The core packages, without which it'd be
hard to set up an editor at all, are:

 - [`@codemirror/state`](##state), which defines data structures
   that represent the [editor state](##state.EditorState) and
   [changes](##state.Transaction) to that state.

 - [`@codemirror/view`](##view), a [display
   component](##view.EditorView) that knows how to show the editor
   state to the user, and translates basic editing actions into state
   updates.

 - [`@codemirror/commands`](##commands) defines a lot of editing
   commands and some [key bindings](##commands.defaultKeymap) for
   them.

This is what a minimal viable editor might look like:

```javascript
import {EditorState} from "@codemirror/state"
import {EditorView, keymap} from "@codemirror/view"
import {defaultKeymap} from "@codemirror/commands"

let startState = EditorState.create({
  doc: "Hello World",
  extensions: [keymap.of(defaultKeymap)]
})

let view = new EditorView({
  state: startState,
  parent: document.body
})
```

Many things that you'd expect in an editor, such as the [line number
gutter](##view.lineNumbers) or [undo history](##h_undo_history), are
implemented as extensions to the generic core, and need to be
explicitly added to a configuration to be enabled. To make it easy to
get started, the [`codemirror`](##codemirror) package pulls in most of
the things you need for a baseline editor (except a language package).

```javascript
import {EditorView, basicSetup} from "codemirror"
import {javascript} from "@codemirror/lang-javascript"

let view = new EditorView({
  extensions: [basicSetup, javascript()],
  parent: document.body
})
```

The packages are distributed as [ES6
modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).
This means that it is not currently practical to run the library
without some kind of bundler (which packages up a modular program into
a single big JavaScript file) or module loader. If you are new to
bundling, I recommend looking into [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) or
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

### Functional Core, Imperative Shell

An attitude that guides the architecture of CodeMirror is that
functional (pure) code, which creates new values instead of having
side effects, is much easier to work with than imperative code. But
the browser DOM is obviously very imperative-minded, as are many of
the systems that CodeMirror integrate with.

To resolve this contradiction, the library's state representation is
strictly functional—the [document](##state.Text) and
[state](##state.EditorState) data structures are immutable, and
operations on them are pure functions, whereas the [view
component](##view.EditorView) and command interface wrap these in an
imperative interface.

This means that an old state value stays intact even when the editor
moves on to a new state. Having both the old and the new state
available is often very useful when dealing with state changes. It
also means that directly changing a state value, or writing extensions
like additional [state fields](##state.StateField) in an imperative
way will not do what you'd hope (and probably just break things).

The TypeScript interface tries to be very clear about this by marking
arrays and object properties as `readonly`. When using plain old
JavaScript it can be harder to remember this. But as a general rule,
unless explicitly described in the docs, reassignment of properties in
objects created by the library is just not supported.

```javascript
let state = EditorState.create({doc: "123"})
// BAD WRONG NO GOOD CODE:
state.doc = Text.of("abc") // <- DON'T DO THIS
```

### State and Updates

The library handles updates in a way inspired by approaches like
[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) or
[Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/). With a few exceptions
(like composition and drag-drop handling), the state of the
[view](##view.EditorView) is entirely determined by the
[`EditorState`](##state.EditorState) value in its
[`state`](##view.EditorView.state) property.

Changes to that state happen in functional code, by
[creating](##state.EditorState.update) a
[transaction](##state.Transaction) that describes the changes to
document, selection, or other state [fields](##state.StateField). Such
a transaction can then be
[dispatched](##view.EditorView.dispatch), which
tells the view to update its state, at which point it'll synchronize
its DOM representation with the new state.

```javascript
// (Assume view is an EditorView instance holding the document "123".)
let transaction = view.state.update({changes: {from: 0, insert: "0"}})
console.log(transaction.state.doc.toString()) // "0123"
// At this point the view still shows the old state.
view.dispatch(transaction)
// And now it shows the new state.
```

The data flow during typical user interaction looks something like
this:

<style>.box { color: white; display: inline-block; border-radius: 5px; padding: 6px 15px; margin: 3px 0; }</style>
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 120%; font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;">
  <div class=box style="background: #c33;">DOM event</div>
  <div>↗<span style="width: 5em; display: inline-block;"></span>↘</div>
  <div>
    <div class=box style="margin: 0 2em 0 3em; background: #55b">view</div>
    <div class=box style="background: #77e">transaction</div>
  </div>
  <div>↖<span style="width: 5em; display: inline-block;"></span>↙</div>
  <div class=box style="background: #446;">new state</div>
</div>

The view listens for events. When DOM events come in, it (or a command
bound to a key, or an event handler registered by an extension)
translates them into state transactions and dispatches them. This
builds up a new state. When that new state is given to the view, it'll
update itself.

### Extension

Since the core library is rather minimal and generic, a lot of
functionality is implemented in system extensions. Extensions can do
all kinds of things, from merely configuring some
[option](##state.EditorState^tabSize), to defining new [fields in the
state object](##state.StateField), to [styling the
editor](##view.EditorView^theme), to [injecting](##view.ViewPlugin)
custom imperative components into the view. The system takes
[care](https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/extensibility.html) to allow
extensions to compose without unexpected conflicts.

The set of active extensions is
[kept](##state.EditorStateConfig.extensions) in the editor state (and
can be [changed](##state.Compartment.reconfigure) by a
transaction). Extensions are provided as [values](##state.Extension)
(usually imported from some package), or arrays of such values. They
can be arbitrarily nested (an array containing more arrays is also a
valid extension), and are deduplicated during the configuration
process. Thus, it is okay for extensions to pull in other
extensions—if the same one gets included multiple times, it'll only
take effect once.

When relevant, the precedence of extensions is determined first by
[explicitly set](##state.Prec) precedence category, and within
that, by the position the extension has in the (flattened) collection
of extensions passed to the state.

```javascript
import {keymap} from "@codemirror/view"
import {EditorState, Prec} from "@codemirror/state"

function dummyKeymap(tag) {
  return keymap.of([{
    key: "Ctrl-Space",
    run() { console.log(tag); return true }
  }])
}

let state = EditorState.create({extensions: [
  dummyKeymap("A"),
  dummyKeymap("B"),
  Prec.high(dummyKeymap("C"))
]})
```

In a view using the state from that code, pressing Ctrl-Space will log
`"C"`, because, despite being last in the order of extensions, that
keymap is tagged with a higher precedence. If that weren't the case,
keymap `"A"` would be the first one to get a chance to handle the key
combination, since it occurs before the others.

A [later section](#extending-codemirror) of the guide goes into more
detail on the kinds of extensions that exist, and how to use them.

### Document Offsets

CodeMirror uses plain numbers to address positions in the document.
These represent character counts—more precisely, they count UTF16 code
units (so astral characters count as two units). Line breaks _always_
count as a single unit (even when you
[configure](##state.EditorState^lineSeparator) a line separator that
is longer than that).

These offsets are used to track the
[selection](##state.SelectionRange.head), position
[changes](##state.ChangeSpec), [decorate content](##view.Decoration),
and so on.

It is sometimes necessary to figure out where a position in a start
document ends up in a changed document. For this purpose, the library
provides a [position mapping](##state.ChangeDesc.mapPos) feature,
which, given a [transaction](##state.Transaction) (or just a [change
set](##state.ChangeSet)) and a start position, can give you the
corresponding new position.

```javascript
import {EditorState} from "@codemirror/state"

let state = EditorState.create({doc: "1234"})
// Delete "23" and insert at "0" at the start.
let tr = state.update({changes: [{from: 1, to: 3}, {from: 0, insert: "0"}]})
// The position at the end of the old document is at 3 in the new document.
console.log(tr.changes.mapPos(4))
```

The document [data structure](##state.Text) also indexes by lines, so
it is not expensive to look things up by (1-based) line number.

```javascript
import {Text} from "@codemirror/state"

let doc = Text.of(["line 1", "line 2", "line 3"])
// Get information about line 2
console.log(doc.line(2)) // {start: 7, end: 13, ...}
// Get the line around position 15
console.log(doc.lineAt(15)) // {start: 14, end: 20, ...}
```

## Data Model

CodeMirror, being a _text_ editor, treats the document as a flat
string. It stores this in a tree-shaped [data structure](##state.Text)
to allow cheap updates anywhere in the document (and efficient
indexing by line number).

### Document Changes

Document changes are themselves [values](##state.ChangeSet),
describing precisely which ranges of the old document are being
replaced by which bits of new text. This allows extensions to track
precisely what happens to the document, allowing things like an [undo
history](##h_undo_history) and [collaborative editing](##collab) to be
implemented outside the library core.

When creating a change set, all changes are described in terms of the
_original_ document—they conceptually all happen at once. (If you
really need to combine lists of changes where later changes refer to
the document created by earlier ones, you can use the change set
[`compose`](##state.ChangeSet.compose) method.)

### Selection

Alongside the document, an editor [state](##state.EditorState) stores
a current [selection](##state.EditorSelection). Selections may consist
of multiple [ranges](##state.SelectionRange), each of which can be a
cursor ([empty](##state.SelectionRange.empty)) or cover a range
between its [anchor](##state.SelectionRange.anchor) and
[head](##state.SelectionRange.head)). Overlapping ranges are
automatically merged, and ranges are sorted, so that a selection's
[`ranges`](##state.EditorSelection.ranges) property always holds a sorted,
non-overlapping array of ranges.

```javascript
import {EditorState, EditorSelection} from "@codemirror/state"

let state = EditorState.create({
  doc: "hello",
  selection: EditorSelection.create([
    EditorSelection.range(0, 4),
    EditorSelection.cursor(5)
  ]),
  extensions: EditorState.allowMultipleSelections.of(true)
})
console.log(state.selection.ranges.length) // 2

let tr = state.update(state.replaceSelection("!"))
console.log(tr.state.doc.toString()) // "!o!"
```

One of these ranges is marked as the
[_main_](##state.EditorSelection.main) one. This is the one that
the browser's DOM selection will reflect. The others are drawn and
handled entirely by the library.

By default a state will only accept selections with a single range. To
get support for multiple selections, you have to include an extension
like [`drawSelection`](##view.drawSelection) that is able to draw
them, and set an [option](##state.EditorState^allowMultipleSelections)
to enable them.

State objects have a convenience method,
[`changeByRange`](##state.EditorState.changeByRange) for applying an
operation to every selection range separately (which can be a bit
awkward to do manually).

```javascript
import {EditorState, EditorSelection} from "@codemirror/state"

let state = EditorState.create({doc: "abcd", selection: {anchor: 1, head: 3}})
// Upcase the selection
let tr = state.update(state.changeByRange(range => {
  let upper = state.sliceDoc(range.from, range.to).toUpperCase()
  return {
    changes: {from: range.from, to: range.to, insert: upper},
    range: EditorSelection.range(range.from, range.from + upper.length)
  }
}))
console.log(tr.state.doc.toString()) // "aBCd"
```

### Configuration

Each editor state also has a (private) reference to its
_configuration_, which is determined by the extensions that are active
for that state. During regular transactions, the configuration stays
the same. But it is possible to reconfigure the state using
[compartments](##state.Compartment) or effects that [add
to](##state.StateEffect^appendConfig) or
[replace](##state.StateEffect^reconfigure) the current configuration.

The direct effects of a state's configuration are the
[fields](##state.StateField) it stores and the values associated with
[facets](##state.Facet) for that state.

### Facets

A _facet_ is an extension point. Different extension values can
[_provide_](##state.Facet.of) values for the facet. And anyone with
access to the state and the facet can
[read](##state.EditorState.facet) its output value. Depending on the
facet, that may just be an array of provided values, or some value
computed from those.

The idea behind facets is that most types of extension allow multiple
inputs, but want to compute some coherent combined value from those.
How that combining works may differ.

 - For something like [tab size](##state.EditorState^tabSize), you
   need a single output value. So that facet takes the value with the
   highest precedence and uses that.

 - When providing [event
   handlers](##view.EditorView^domEventHandlers), you want the
   handlers as an array, sorted by precedence, so that you can try
   them one at a time until one of them handles the event.

 - Another common pattern is to compute the logical _or_ of the input
   values (as in
   [`allowMultipleSelections`](##state.EditorState^allowMultipleSelections))
   or reduce them in some other way (say, taking the maximum of the
   requested undo history depths).

```javascript
import {EditorState} from "@codemirror/state"

let state = EditorState.create({
  extensions: [
    EditorState.tabSize.of(16),
    EditorState.changeFilter.of(() => true)
  ]
})
console.log(state.facet(EditorState.tabSize)) // 16
console.log(state.facet(EditorState.changeFilter)) // [() => true]
```

Facets are explicitly [defined](##state.Facet^define), producing a
facet value. Such a value can be exported, to allow other code to
provide and read it, or it can be kept module-private, in which case
only that module can access it. We'll come back to that in the section
on [writing extensions](#extending-codemirror).

In a given configuration, most facets tend to be static, provided only
directly as part of the configuration. But it is also possible to have
facet values [computed](##state.Facet.compute) from other aspects of
the state.

Facet values are only recomputed when necessary, so you can use an
object or array identity test to cheaply check whether a facet
changed.

### Transactions

Transactions, created with the state's
[`update`](##state.EditorState.update) method, combine a number of
effects (all optional):

 - It can apply [document changes](##state.TransactionSpec.changes).

 - It can explicitly move the
   [selection](##state.TransactionSpec.selection). Note that when
   there are document changes, but no explicit new selection, the
   selection will be implicitly [mapped](##state.EditorSelection.map)
   through these changes.

 - It can set a [flag](##state.TransactionSpec.scrollIntoView) that
   instructs the view to scroll the (main) selection head into
   view.

 - It can have any number of
   [annotations](##state.TransactionSpec.annotations), which store
   additional metadata that describes the (entire) transaction. For
   example, the [`userEvent`](##state.Transaction^userEvent)
   annotation can be used to recognize transactions generated for
   certain common operations like typing or pasting.

 - It can have [effects](##state.TransactionSpec.effects), which are
   self-contained additional effects, typically on some extension's
   state (such as folding code or starting an autocompletion).

 - It can influence the state's configuration, either by providing a
   completely [new](##state.StateEffect^reconfigure) set of
   extensions, or by [replacing](##state.Compartment.reconfigure)
   specific [parts](##state.Compartment) of the configuration.

To completely reset a state—for example to load a new document—it is
recommended to create a new state instead of a transaction. That will
make sure no unwanted state (such as undo history events) sticks
around.

## The View

The view tries to be as transparent a layer around the state as
possible. Unfortunately, there are some aspects of working with an
editor that can't be handled purely with the data in the state.

 - When dealing with screen coordinates (to [figure
   out](##view.EditorView.posAtCoords) where the user clicked, or to
   find the [coordinates](##view.EditorView.coordsAtPos) of a given
   position), you need access to the layout, and thus the browser DOM.

 - The editor takes the [text
   direction](##view.EditorView.textDirection) from the surrounding
   document (or its own CSS style, if overridden).

 - Cursor motion can depend on layout and text direction. Thus, the
   view provides a number of helper methods for computing
   [different](##view.EditorView.moveByChar)
   [types](##view.EditorView.moveByGroup)
   [of](##view.EditorView.moveToLineBoundary)
   [motion](##view.EditorView.moveVertically).

 - Some state, such as [focus](##view.EditorView.hasFocus) and [scroll
   position](##view.EditorView^scrollIntoView), isn't stored in the
   functional state, but left in the DOM.

The library does not expect user code to manipulate the DOM
structure it manages. When you do try that, you'll probably just see
the library revert your changes right away. See the section on
[decorations](#decorating-the-document) for the proper way to affect
the way the content is displayed.

### Viewport

One thing to be aware of is that CodeMirror doesn't render the entire
document, when that document is big. To avoid doing some work, it
will, when updating, detect which part of the content is currently
visible (not scrolled out of view), and only render that plus a margin
around it. This is called the [viewport](##view.EditorView.viewport).

Querying coordinates for positions outside of the current viewport
will not work (since they are not rendered, and thus have no layout).
The view does track [height
information](##view.EditorView.lineBlockAtHeight) (initially
estimated, measured accurately when content is drawn) for the entire
document, even the parts outside of the viewport.

Long lines (when not wrapped) or chunks of folded code can still make
the viewport rather huge. The editor also provides a list of [visible
ranges](##view.EditorView.visibleRanges), which won't include such
invisible content. This can be useful when, for example, highlighting
code, where you don't want to do work for text that isn't visible
anyway.

### Update Cycle

CodeMirror's view makes a serious effort to minimize the amount of DOM
[reflows](https://sites.google.com/site/getsnippet/javascript/dom/repaints-and-reflows-manipulating-the-dom-responsibly)
it causes. [Dispatching](##view.EditorView.dispatch) a transaction
will generally only cause the editor to write to the DOM, without
reading layout information. The reading (to check whether the viewport
is still valid, whether the cursor needs to be scrolled into view, and
so on) is done in a separate _measure_ phase, scheduled using
[`requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame).
This phase will, if necessary, follow up with another write phase.

You can schedule your own measure code using the
[`requestMeasure`](##view.EditorView.requestMeasure) method.

To avoid weird reentrancy situations, the view will raise an error
when a new update is initiated while another update is in the process
of being (synchronously) applied. Multiple updates applied while a
measure phase is still pending are not a problem—those will just cause
their measure phases to be combined.

When you are done with a view instance, you must call its
[`destroy`](##view.EditorView.destroy) method to dispose of it,
releasing any resources (global event handlers and mutation
observers) that it allocated.

### DOM Structure

The editor's DOM structure looks something like this:

```html
<div class="cm-editor [theme scope classes]">
  <div class="cm-scroller">
    <div class="cm-content" contenteditable="true">
      <div class="cm-line">Content goes here</div>
      <div class="cm-line">...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

The outer (`wrap`) element is a vertical flexbox. Things like
[panels](##h_panels) and [tooltips](##h_tooltips) can be put here by
extensions.

Inside of that is the `scroller` element. If the editor has its own
scrollbar, this one should be styled with `overflow: auto`. But it
doesn't have to—the editor also supports growing to accomodate its
content, or growing up to a certain `max-height` and then scrolling.

The `scroller` is a horizontal flexbox element. When there are
gutters, they are added to its start.

Inside that is the `content` element, which is editable. This has a
DOM [mutation
observer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver)
registered on it, and any changes made in there will result in the
editor parsing them as document changes and redrawing the affected
nodes. This container holds a `line` element for each line in the
viewport, which in turn hold the document text (possibly
[decorated](##view.Decoration) with styles or widgets).

### Styles and Themes

To manage editor-related styles, CodeMirror uses a
[system](https://github.com/marijnh/style-mod) to inject styles from
JavaScript. Styles can be [registered](##view.EditorView^styleModule)
with a facet, which will cause the view to make sure they are
available.

Many elements in the editor are assigned classes prefixed with `cm-`.
These can be styled directly in your local CSS. But they can also be
targeted by themes. A theme is an extension created with
[`EditorView.theme`](##view.EditorView^theme). It gets its own unique
(generated) CSS class (which will be added to the editor when the
theme extension is active) and defines styles scoped by that class.

A theme declaration defines any number of CSS rules using
[style-mod](https://github.com/marijnh/style-mod) notation. This code
creates a crude theme that makes the default text color in the editor
orange:

```javascript
import {EditorView} from "@codemirror/view"

let view = new EditorView({
  extensions: EditorView.theme({
    ".cm-content": {color: "darkorange"},
    "&.cm-focused .cm-content": {color: "orange"}
  })
})
```

To allow the automatic class prefixing be done correctly, rules where
the first element targets the editor's wrapper element (which is
where the theme's unique class will be added), such as the
`.cm-focused` rule in the example, must use an `&` character to
indicate the position of the wrapper element.

Extensions can define [base themes](##view.EditorView^baseTheme) to
provide default styles for the elements they create. Base themes can
use `&light` (default) and `&dark` (enabled when there's a dark theme
active) placeholders, so that even when they aren't overridden by a
theme, they don't look too out of place.

```javascript
import {EditorView} from "@codemirror/view"

// This again produces an extension value
let myBaseTheme = EditorView.baseTheme({
  "&dark .cm-mySelector": { background: "dimgrey" },
  "&light .cm-mySelector": { background: "ghostwhite" }
})
```

### Commands

[Commands](##view.Command) are functions with a specific signature.
Their main use is [key bindings](##view.KeyBinding), but they could
also be used for things like menu items or command palettes. A command
function represents a user action. It takes a
[view](##view.EditorView) and returns a boolean, `false` to indicate
it doesn't apply in the current situation, and `true` to indicate that
it successfully executed. The effect of the command is produced
imperatively, usually by [dispatching](##view.EditorView.dispatch) a
transaction.

When multiple commands are bound to a given key, they are tried one at
a time, in order of precedence, until one of them returns `true`.

Commands that only act on the state, not the entire view, can use the
[`StateCommand`](##state.StateCommand) type instead, which is a
subtype of [`Command`](##view.Command) that just expects its argument
to have `state` and `dispatch` properties. This is mostly useful for
being able to test such commands without creating a view.

## Extending CodeMirror

There are a number of different ways to extend CodeMirror, and picking
the proper way for a given use case isn't always obvious. This section
goes over the various concepts you'll need to be familiar with to
write editor extensions.

### State Fields

Extensions often need to store additional information in the state.
The undo [history](##commands.history) needs to store undoable
changes, the code [folding](##h_folding) extension needs to track what
has been folded, and so on.

For this purpose, extensions can define additional [state
fields](##state.StateField). State fields, living inside the purely
functional [state](##state.EditorState) data structure, must store
immutable values.

State fields are kept in sync with the rest of the state using
something like a [reducer](https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers/).
Every time the state updates, a function is called with the field's
current value and the transaction, which should return the field's new
value.

```javascript
import {EditorState, StateField} from "@codemirror/state"

let countDocChanges = StateField.define({
  create() { return 0 },
  update(value, tr) { return tr.docChanged ? value + 1 : value }
})

let state = EditorState.create({extensions: countDocChanges})
state = state.update({changes: {from: 0, insert: "."}}).state
console.log(state.field(countDocChanges)) // 1
```

You will often want to use [annotations](##state.Annotation) or
[effects](##state.StateEffect) to communicate what is happening to
your state field.

It can be tempting to try to avoid taking the step of putting state in
an actual state field—there's a bit of verbosity involved in declaring
one, and firing off a whole transaction for every state change may
feel a bit heavyweight. But in almost all cases, it is a _really_ good
idea to tie your state into the editor-wide state update cycle,
because it makes it a lot easier to keep everything in sync.

### Affecting the View

[View plugins](##view.ViewPlugin) provide a way for extensions to run
an imperative component inside the view. This is useful for things
like event handlers, adding and managing DOM elements, and doing
things that depend on the current viewport.

This simple plugin displays the document size in the editor's corner.

```javascript
import {ViewPlugin} from "@codemirror/view"

const docSizePlugin = ViewPlugin.fromClass(class {
  constructor(view) {
    this.dom = view.dom.appendChild(document.createElement("div"))
    this.dom.style.cssText =
      "position: absolute; inset-block-start: 2px; inset-inline-end: 5px"
    this.dom.textContent = view.state.doc.length
  }

  update(update) {
    if (update.docChanged)
      this.dom.textContent = update.state.doc.length
  }

  destroy() { this.dom.remove() }
})

View plugins should generally not hold (non-derived) state. They work
best as shallow views over the data kept in the editor state.

When the state is reconfigured, view plugins that aren't part of the
new configuration will be destroyed (which is why, if they made
changes to the editor, they should define a `destroy` method that
undoes those changes).

When a view plugin crashes, it is automatically disabled to avoid
taking down the entire view.

### Decorating the Document

When not told otherwise, CodeMirror will draw the document as plain
text. _Decorations_ are the mechanism through which extensions can
influence what the document looks like. They come in four types:

 - [Mark decorations](##view.Decoration^mark) add style or DOM
   attributes to the text in a given range.

 - [Widget decorations](##view.Decoration^widget) insert a DOM element
   at a given position in the document.

 - [Replace decorations](##view.Decoration^replace) hide part of the
   document or replace it with a given DOM node.

 - [Line decorations](##view.Decoration^line) can add attributes to a
   line's wrapping element.

Decorations are provided through a
[facet](##view.EditorView^decorations). Every time the view is
updated, the content of this facet is used to style the visible
content.

Decorations are kept in [sets](##state.RangeSet), which are again
immutable data structures. Such sets can be
[mapped](##state.RangeSet.map) across changes (adjusting the
positions of their content to compensate for the change) or
[rebuilt](##state.RangeSetBuilder) on updates, depending on the use
case.

There are two ways in which decorations can be provided: directly, by
putting the range set value in the facet (often by
[deriving](##state.StateField^define^config.provide) it from a field),
or indirectly, by providing a function from a view to a range set.

Only directly provided decoration sets may influence the vertical
block structure of the editor, but only indirectly provided ones can
read the editor's viewport (which can be useful if you want to, for
example, decorate only the [visible
content](##view.EditorView.visibleRanges)). The reason for this
restriction is that the viewport is computed _from_ the block
structure, so that must be known before the viewport can be read.

### Extension Architecture

To create a given piece of editor functionality you often need to
combine different kinds of extension: a state field to keep state, a
base theme to provide styling, a view plugin to manage in- and output,
some commands, maybe a facet for configuration.

A common pattern is to export a function that returns the extension
values necessary for your feature to work. Making this a function,
even if it doesn't (yet) take parameters is a good idea—it makes it
possible to add configuration options later, without breaking
backwards compatiblity.

Since extensions can pull in other extensions, it can be useful to
consider what happens when your extension is included multiple times.
For some kinds of extensions, for example keymaps, it is appropriate
to just do the thing it's doing multiple times. But often that would
be wasteful or even break something.

It is usually possible to make multiple uses of an extension just do
the right thing by relying on the deduplication of identical extension
values—if you make sure you create your static extension values
(themes, state fields, view plugins, etc) only once, and always return
the same instance from your extension constructor function, you'll
only get one copy of them in the editor.

But when your extension allows configuration, your other logic will
probably need access to that. And what do you do when the different
instances of the extension got different configurations?

Sometimes, that's just an error. But often, it is possible to define a
strategy for reconciling them. Facets work well for this. You can put
the configuration in a module-private facet, and have its
[combining](##state.Facet^define^config.combine) function either
reconcile configurations or thow an error when this is impossible.
Then code that needs access to the current configuration can read that
facet.

See the [zebra stripes](../../examples/zebra) example for an
illustration of this approach.
